## ðŸ“– Overview

This is my personal Kubernetes cluster. [Flux CD](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) 
watches this Git repository and makes the changes to my cluster based on the 
manifests in the [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) directory. 
[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) also watches this Git repository 
and creates pull requests when it finds updates to Docker images, Helm charts and 
other dependencies.
