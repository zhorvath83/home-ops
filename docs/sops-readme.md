# Mozilla SOPS

The integrity of each document is guaranteed by calculating a Message Authentication
Code (MAC) that is stored encrypted by the data key. When decrypting a document, the
MAC should be recalculated and compared with the MAC stored in the document to verify
that no fraudulent changes have been applied. The MAC covers keys and values as well
as their ordering.

```bash
brew install gnupg sops
```

Copy .sops.yaml from the root to the client.

Import public key: `gpg --import gpg-public.asc`
Import private key: `gpg --import gpg-private.asc`

Encrypt file:
`sops --encrypt --in-place YOUR_SECRET.yaml`

In case of MAC mismatch:
`sops --ignore-mac YOUR_SECRET.yaml`
