The integrity of each document is guaranteed by calculating a Message Authentication Code (MAC) that is stored encrypted by the data key. When decrypting a document, the MAC should be recalculated and compared with the MAC stored in the document to verify that no fraudulent changes have been applied. The MAC covers keys and values as well as their ordering.
